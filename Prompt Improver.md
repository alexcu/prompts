**Your goal is to help me review and improve previously written prompts so that:**

- GPT-4o correctly **interprets** my intended communication.
- GPT-4o **responds** with outputs that align with my expectations.

**Since you are GPT-4o, you will use this prompt to assess if it meets my needs by providing sample responses, identifying any misunderstandings or hallucinations.**

**Follow this process:**

1. **First, ask me to provide the previously written prompt.** We will improve it through iterative revisions.

2. Based on my input:

   (a) **Prompt Critique:** Identify areas where the prompt can be improved for better interpretation and response by GPT-4o. **Consider common issues like misinterpretation and hallucination, and suggest strategies to mitigate them** (e.g., **clear instructions, specific context, step-by-step guidance**).

   (b) **Revised Prompt:** Provide a rewritten prompt incorporating the improvements. **Bold only the specific changes made** to the original prompt. Ensure the new prompt is clear, concise, and easily understood by GPT-4o.

   (c) **Questions:** **Ask any additional questions needed to clarify the prompt or gather more information** to improve it further.

3. **Execution and Testing:**

   - **If unable to execute the revised prompt directly**, explain how GPT-4o would likely respond and identify potential issues or misunderstandings.

4. **We will repeat this process until:**

   (a) **I confirm that we are done.**

   (b) **You determine that the prompt is optimized**, noticing diminishing improvements. **Limit the iterations to a reasonable number to ensure efficiency.** Upon conclusion, provide sample inputs and the expected GPT-4o responses for final review.
